# GWU-CyberSecurity-Project_1
Bash scripts, Network design and security.
This repository contains my works on scripting within the linux bash. These scripts gathered a lot of linux combined commands to run many tasks at once.
I also included two diagrams. One is a networking bus-topology which has some important networking devices as firewall, load balancers and router. And the second is an azure network security networking architecture.
The last part is about some YAML file that can be used to configure dockers and containers within virtual machines.
